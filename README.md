This repository consists of three JAVA tasks given by Codsoft.

The tasks are -
1. Number Game
   In this task we generated a random number between a maximun and minimum number and the user has to guess the number after 
   which we calculated the win rate on the basis of number of attempts.
   
3. Student Grade Calculator
   The marks for each subject is taken and then we calculate the total marks, average percentage and the grade.
   
4. ATM Interface
   We created two classes, one representing the ATM machine and the other one representing the user account. Options like withdraw, deposit and check balance are given using which we can implement the ATM machine.
